### ZKML community

We are in the process of bootstrapping a ZKML community where people can share research ideas, code they are working on and potential applications of this nascent technology. If you are interested in joining, check out our [Telegram](https://t.me/zkmlcommunity). There are few ideas we have come up with for the community:

- Create a group of people working on or that are interested in doing research in the ZKML domain. 
- See what everyone is working on and find intersections where a potential for collaboration could appear.
- Map out the general direction of ZKML - use cases / academic research
- Find people that are able to support work in this domain with capital, manpower, research capacity (i.e. PhD students), engineers, etc.
- Co-organize a Gitcoin side round for ZKML
- Create some form of grants program to support further R&D and exisiting initiatives (think 0xPARC)
- Nerdsnipe researchers and engineers to work on ZKML
- Start a sub-fund under a DAO/org earmarked for zkml.
- Create educational materials for ZKML
- Organize ZKML events (online and in-person)

### Use cases

Decision tree for a use case that would use ZKML -> Intersection of {needs privacy, computational integrity} and {heuristic optimization problem solved by ml}.

- Worldcoin
   - Verifying that a user has created a valid and unique [WorldID](https://worldcoin.org/the-worldcoin-protocol) locally by running a [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) on self-hosted biometric data and is calling [_addMember(uint256 groupId, uint256 identityCommitment)](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/blob/4e6be04729ed2d7e29461a3915877a66a2c9c4d2/contracts/base/SemaphoreGroups.sol#L43) function on the WorldID Semaphore identity group with a valid identityCommitment. -> Makes protocol more permissionless
